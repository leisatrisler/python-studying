# In Python there are aritmetic operators, but there is another set called comparison operators
# Use this operators to compare values
x = 3 > 2
print(x)  # When ran we get a Boolean answer

x = 3 >= 2
print(x)
x = 3 < 2
print(x)
x = 3 <= 2
print(x)
x = 3 == 2  # Equality operator, do not confuse this with assignment operator # Here we compare 3 & 2 for equality
print(x)
x = 3 != 2  # Not equality operator,indicated by !, followed by =

>  # Greater than
>=  # Greater than or equal to
<  # Less than
<=  # Less than or equal to
==  # Equal to
!=  # Not equal
