# 3 types of data in python - (numbers) 10, (strings) "Mosh", & (Boolean) True
# There are times you want to convert the value of a varable from one type to another
birth_year = input("Enter your birth year: ")  # 1st line input function
# 2nd line we passed a string to our end function, and will return the end function of the birth year, then we subtract it from 2020
age = 2020 - int(birth_year)
print(age)  # 3rd line we get the age and store it in the age variable
